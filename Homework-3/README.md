# 3DMP -  Homework no. 3
Hard deadline:  24.03.2021 | 23:59:59
Tasks:
Turn on capture history (the homework will not be graded if capture history is not turned on).
- [x] Import an SVG (link here) and design a chess pieces set: 
- [x] 1 pawn, 
- [x] 1 knight, 
- [x] 1 bishop, 
- [x] 1 rook, 
- [x] 1 queen,
- [x] 1 king.
Use the SVG sketch to revolve the pieces: 
you need to take care when designing the knight; only the base should be revolved; find another solution for the horse part e.g: extrusion, fillet, etc.
when designing the bishop, revolve the part that doesn’t have the slit, and add the slit after.


When using revolve, you need two things: the profile and the axis:
For the profile, you will use half of the chess piece (Fig. 3.1 dark blue part)
For the axis, you will use a line (Fig. 3.1 the red line) that cuts the piece in half. 
You need to add this line by yourself, editing the SVG sketch using constraints (don’t add it using a new sketch, it needs to be in the same sketch for the revolve to work).
Use a circular pattern to add details on the top, neck and base of the pieces.
The SVG is a little bit stylized. The chess pieces contain smaller parts that are not connected. For the full grade, you need to find a way to make each chess piece only one body! 


- [x] Slice all the pieces in PrusaSlicer. 
	    BONUS: Make the board as well. Multiply the pieces and align them on the board. Add appearance (videos about appearance can be found in the course).
